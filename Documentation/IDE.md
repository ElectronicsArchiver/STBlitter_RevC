## IDE

By default `Interface 0` responds to the **IDE interface**.

<br>

If you wish to change this, you will have to use<br>
the soldering jumpers labeled `IDE address`.

The **IDE Interface** is determined by the following:

|  JumperA  |  JumperB  | Interface |
|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
|           |           |     0     |
|           | Connected |     1     |
| Connected |           |     2     |
| Connected | Connected |     3     |

<br>

If you however wish to **disable** the **IDE Interface**<br>
you will have to connect the `IDE Disable` jumper.
