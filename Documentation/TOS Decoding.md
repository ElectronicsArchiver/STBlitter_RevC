# TOS Decoding

The current firmware `no longer required the original ROM CE` from<br>
the motherboard, the **RCEI** on the leftmost header near the CPU socket.

It can fully decode `TOS1.xx`, `TOS2.xx` and `TOS3.xx`<br>
**ROMs** as well as send the `CE Signal` on the **RCEO** pin.

<br>

This feature can be disabled with the `ROM disable` jumper.
